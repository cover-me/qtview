To find stored files (Chrome): shift + right-click (or right-click if not in Jupyter) -> inspect, in a line showing "Elements Console Recorder ...", find "Application" (may hide behind the ">>" icon), go to "IndexedDB -> JupyterLite Storage -> files". Default files are not stored to this place unless they are modified. You can clear all files there so default files would appear (or one by one in the file browser).
